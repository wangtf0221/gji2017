\section{conclusion}
We analyse the radiation patterns under the consideration of separated wave modes.The
results show that the separated wave mode may help to enhance the energy of the
scattered wavefield with different combination schemes.Especially, the choice of
combination in terms of $V_{nmo}$ will greatly strengthen the radiation pattern
amplitude.
